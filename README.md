Incomplete fishing bot for the game No Man's Sky
Other features could be implemented easily but I'm stuck on fishing.
Scanning for the initial fishing indicator using PyAutoGUI and Pillow, then attempting to use PyMem to detect whether a fish is on the hook. 
Work in progress. 
Anyone with a solution to finding the state of the fishing line, without extensive reverse engineering, please let me know.
