# No Man's Sky Fishing Bot 

  Incomplete fishing bot for the game No Man's Sky.

  Messing around with PyAutoGUI.

  NMS does not like the way PyAutoGUI does keypresses so used PyDirectInput to work with directx

# Usage

  Find a spot to fish a bit above the water to avoid storms moving you.

  Set NMS to windowed 1080p mode

  Keep window at top left of screen on main monitor

  Equip fishing rig and make sure the indicator is clearly visible

  Run the bot and refocus NMS window

  Profit

# Tips

  The script will run even if NMS is not running.

  Some planets have wacky color filters. If that is the case, and the bot is not working,
  you can adjust tolerances for color selection within the script. 

  NMS must be on main monitor to function.
